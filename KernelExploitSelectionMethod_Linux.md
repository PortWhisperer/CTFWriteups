# Privilege Escalation - Linux Kernel Exploit Identification

Identifying kernel exploits for \*Nix systems can be difficult. Using multiple methods can help narrow the candidate exploit list.


## Searchsploit
```
searchsploit [name of  software]
```

## Google 
Entering portions of the uname -a output into Google can result in links to solid candidates not found in Searchsploit/Exploit-DB

## Linux Exploit Suggester
Three chief methods (by order of desirability):
1) Use with input list of CVE's applicable to kernel [[#KSplice|Generate applicable CVE list with KSplice]] (LES Developer [Recommended](https://mzet-.github.io/2019/05/10/les-paper.html)):
 ```$SHELL linux-exploit-suggester.sh --cvelist-file```
2)  On target host, execute:
```$SHELL linux-exploit-suggester.sh```
3)  Collect ```uname -a``` output on victim host and execute the following on a host with the script (quote the supplied uname string):
```$SHELL linux-exploit-suggester.sh --uname [output of `uname -a` on victim host]```

4) *(Optional)* To understand why some exploits will or won't work, the following can assist (warning, advanced \*nix kernel details output ):
```$SHELL linux-exploit-suggester.sh --checksec```

## KSplice
Output of the below steps is a flat file containing relevant CVE IDs for the supplied uname strings: 
1) Run the following on the target host:
```(uname -s; uname -m; uname -r; uname -v)```
 2) Exfiltrate the output (copy via terminal or otherwise)
3) Store output in uname_output.txt
4) Use curl submit the data to KSplice's API: 
```curl https://api-ksplice.oracle.com/api/1/update-list/ \ -L -H "Accept: text/text" --data-binary @"uname_output.txt"```
